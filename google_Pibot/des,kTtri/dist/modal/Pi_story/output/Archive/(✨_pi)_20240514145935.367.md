To execute a command from your `.zshrc` file in the current shell session, you can source the file using the following command:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
This will execute all the commands in the `.zshrc` file in the current shell session, including any aliases, functions, environment variable settings, and other configurations.

If you want to run a specific command that is defined in your `.zshrc` file, you can either copy and paste the command from the file or use the `sed` command to extract and execute it. For example, if the command you want to run is:
```ruby
alias dev='cd /path/to/dev/directory'
```
You can extract and execute it using the following command:
```bash
sed -n '/alias dev=/s/.*=//p' ~/.zshrc | bash
```
This command uses `sed` to search for the line containing the `alias dev` command in the `.zshrc` file, extract the command after the `=` sign, and pipe it to the `bash` command to execute it.

Note that modifying your `.zshrc` file can affect your shell environment, so it's a good practice to make a backup before making any changes.
