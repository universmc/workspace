It seems like you are trying to run a Groq query, but the query itself is not provided. The query you have given, `groq -R projectInfo()`, is incomplete.

`groq` is a query language used for retrieving data from a Groq database. The `-R` flag is used to run the query in "read-only" mode.

The `projectInfo()` function is a built-in function in Groq that returns information about the current project, such as its name, description, and version.

To run a complete Groq query, you need to provide a valid Groq expression that specifies the data you want to retrieve from the database. Here's an example query that retrieves the first 10 documents from a collection called "myCollection":

```
*[_type == "myCollection"] | order(publishedAt desc) | [0:9]
```

You can replace "myCollection" with the name of your collection, and modify the query as needed to retrieve the data you want.

Once you have a valid Groq query, you can run it using the `groq` command followed by the query. For example:

```
groq '*[_type == "myCollection"] | order(publishedAt desc) | [0:9]'
```

This will execute the query and return the first 10 documents from the specified collection.
