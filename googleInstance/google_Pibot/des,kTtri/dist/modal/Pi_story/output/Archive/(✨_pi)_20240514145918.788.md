To execute a command from your `.zshrc` file, you can use the `source` command followed by the path to the file. Here's an example:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
This will execute all the commands in your `.zshrc` file, including any aliases, functions, environment variables, etc. that you have defined.

If you want to execute a specific command from the `.zshrc` file, you can either find the line where the command is defined and copy-paste it into your terminal or use the `grep` command to search for the command and then execute it. Here's an example:
```bash
grep -A 1 'dev input shell' ~/.zshrc | grep -v '^#' | head -n 1
```
This command will search for the string `dev input shell` in your `.zshrc` file and print the line that contains the command. The `-A 1` option tells `grep` to print one line after the match, which is useful if the command is split across two lines. The second `grep` command removes any commented lines (lines starting with `#`), and the `head` command selects the first line of output.

Once you have the command, you can execute it by copy-pasting it into your terminal.
