The `groq -L` command is used to list all the libraries that are currently available in the Groq database.

The `groq -R projectInfo()` command is used to retrieve information about the current project, such as its name, description, and the number of datasets and libraries that it contains.

It is important to note that these commands are only valid in the context of the Groq database, which is a specialized database system designed for use with the Groq programming language. In order to use these commands, you must have access to a Groq database and the appropriate permissions to execute queries.
